# Minehut Meta
Welcome to the [Minehut](https://minehut.com) Meta GitHub repo! This is *the* place to **report bugs**, **suggest features and improvements**, and **request to modify the filter** for Minehut, the server hosting network! You can also participate in conversations about feature requests and bug reports. 

We would like to improve communication with our users by providing official channels to report problems and tell us your ideas. This space will be taken as an approach to see if you feel comfortable reporting and tracking your issues by means of this tool. This document (called the README) will serve as a starting point for making your first issue.

## General Introduction
This is the Minehut Meta GitHub repository. Here, you can tell us about your features and ideas that you want to be added to Minehut and you can also report bugs that need to be squashed. We use GitHub's Issue Tracker feature to track bug reports and feature requests.

We understand you might not have much experience using GitHub, and that's fine! We'll do our best to help you navigate this tracker. We can start by introducing some key terms you'll be hearing a lot:
- **Issue**: A **feature request** or **bug** report.
- **Repository** or **repo**: Refers to the group of Minehut Meta pages. Includes the **issue** tracker and documents (like this one).
- **Bug**: Any piece of unintended behaviour anywhere on Minehut. Basically, if something isn't working how it should, it's a bug.
- **Feature Request**: Anything you would like Minehut to add. If its not already on Minehut, and you think it should be, it's a feature request.
- **Valid**: If an **issue** is correct. Reproducible? Correct information? Actually an issue?
- **Reproducible**: If a **bug** report can be copied or induced by other people. A bug report must be **reproducible** to be **valid**.

Now that you're an expert on the technical jargon we use to manage issues, you're one step closer to making your first issue!

## Community Expectations
We expect members of the community participating in conversations here to act in a civil manner and to keep this forum productive and enjoyable. Users who break rules will have their messages deleted and they may be permanently banned from participating depending on the circumstances.

## Submitting An Issue
> ⚠️ **Important!** If you discover a potential security exploit or vulnerability, please do not report it here! Check our [Security Policy](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/security/policy) for more information.

- Once you're ready to submit your bug report or feature request, head over to [this page](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/issues/new/choose) to begin the process
- You can also comment on other issues and participate in other conversations. Remember, if you want to show support or general disagreement of an issue, use 👍 and 👎 reactions. You can also [sort issues by 👍 reactions](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) (also [by 👎 if you'd like](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions--1-desc))

#### Do
- Help out staff if asked
- Contribute to on-going discussions
- Give constructive feedback to ideas
- Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue has not already been submitted before making a new post (use the search bar on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/issues))
- Verify the validity of your issue
- Be clear, concise and specific in your messages
- Keep conversations on-topic
- Be respectful toward everyone
- Take advantage of [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) -- it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! 😄
- Create a separate issue for each feature request/bug report (don't talk about multiple things in one issue)

#### Don't
- Bump issues for the sole purpose of receiving a response (all issues are acknowledged)
- Argue unproductively in the comments
- Stray off-topic
- Try to get support for Minehut services here -- [read this](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/blob/master/SUPPORT.md)
- Use logical fallacies in arguments
- Recreate an issue you feel was unjustly closed -- if you feel an issue was unjustly closed, feel free to add a comment to the issue explaining why
- Add comments such as 👍, +1, or "I like this idea" -- use [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)! Don't leave a comment on the post such as `bump` or `+1`, leave a reaction instead. We can measure those :)
