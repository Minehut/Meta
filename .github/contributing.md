# How to properly make a request in Minehut Meta

So, you want to suggest a feature, report a bug, or maybe suggest a change for the filter? Always remember to follow these guidelines: 

1. Use the issue templates provided
2. Help out staff if asked
3. Contribute to on-going discussions
4. Give constructive feedback to ideas
5. Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue has not already been submitted before making a new post (use the search bar on the Issues page)
6. Verify the validity of your issue
7. Be clear, concise and specific in your messages
8. Keep conversations on-topic
9. Be respectful toward everyone
10. Take advantage of GitHub Flavoured Markdown -- it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! üòÑ
11. Create a separate issue for each feature request/bug report (don't talk about multiple things in one issue)


1. Don't bump issues for the sole purpose of receiving a response (all issues are acknowledged)
2. Don't argue unproductively in the comments
3. Don't stray off-topic
4. Don't try to get support for Minehut services here -- read this
5. Don't use logical fallacies in arguments
6. Don't recreate an issue you feel was unjustly closed -- if you feel an issue was unjustly closed, feel free to add a comment to the issue explaining why
7. Don't add comments such as üëç, +1, or "I like this idea" -- use reactions! We can measure those :)
